riffle is a lightweight Java library for executing collections of dependent processes as a single process.

  This library provides Java Annotations for tagging classes and methods supporting required life-cycle stages, and
  a simple utility for invoking instances of those classes in dependency order.

  It is intended that more robust workflow tools adopt these Annotations allowing users and developers across
  diverse projects to implement and link to a single life-cycle model without inheriting any incompatible
  license restrictions.

  See the Cascading open-source project for an alternative tool for executing riffle Annotated classes.
